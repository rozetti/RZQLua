# RZQLua
Qt extensions to the RZLua library (which provides c++ bindings to Lua)

## Samples
The stanard Qt [openglunderqml](http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qtquick-scenegraph-openglunderqml-example.html "Link to the openglunderqml sample on the Qt site") sample is included verbatim and then modded to do the GL rendering from within a Lua script. To build the sample, grab the repo and uncheck "shadow build" on both projects.
